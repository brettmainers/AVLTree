This program expands on binary search trees and adds self-balancing logic to turn them into AVL Trees. A height value and method was added to store and update the height of each node. The balance method was also added to determine if the tree needs to be balanced or not. If the tree needs to be rebalanced, the left and right rotation methods were added to accomplish the balancing.
